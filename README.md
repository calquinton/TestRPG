# Overview

"Test RPG" is a demo meant to demonstrate player animations, movement, and collisions in the Godot 3.5 game engine. To play, open the project in Godot and navigate to "TestRPG/world/World.tscn," then open "world.tscn" in the editor. Then, in the top right corner of the editor, click the "play" button. The game will open in a new testing window for you to play. Move the character using the arrow keys (the directional pad on the Steam Deck is also confirmed to work), and notice the player's acceleration and deceleration, collision with multiple objects, and fluid animations.

I wrote this software to learn the basics of game development in Godot. Though I have much to learn, I am very happy with how it turned out!
